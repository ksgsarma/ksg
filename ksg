crashing hit a wall right now i need a miracle right yup now i need a miracle 
stranded reaching down i call your name but youre not around i say your name but youre not around 
i need ya i need ya i need you right now ya i need you right now 
so dont let me dont let me dont let me down
i think im losing my mind now 
its in my head
darling i hope
that youll be here when i need you the most so 
dont let me dont let me dont let me down 
so dont let me down
dont let me down
( music )
