crashing hit a wall right now i need a miracle right yup now i need a miracle 
stranded reaching down i call your name but youre not around i say your name but youre not around 
i need ya i need ya i need you right now ya i need you right now 
so dont let me dont let me dont let me down
i think im losing my mind now 
its in my head
darling i hope
that youll be here when i need you the most so 
dont let me dont let me dont let me down 
so dont let me down
dont let me down
( music )

come on come on turn the radio on 
its friday night and it wont be long
gotta do my hair with my high heels on 
its friday night and it wont be long 
till i hit the dance floor hit the dance floor
i got what i all need 
i got no cash i got no cash
i got you baby
baby i dont need dollar bills to have fun tonight
i love cheap thrills
baby i dont need dollar bills to have fun tonight 
i love cheap thrils
i dont need no money
as long a i keep dancing
